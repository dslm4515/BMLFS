# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

xev: xev (X11 event viewer)
xev:
xev: xev creates a window and then asks the X server to send it X11 events
xev: whenever anything happens to the window (such as it being moved,
xev: resized, typed in, clicked in, etc.). You can also attach it to an
xev: existing window. It is useful for seeing what causes events to occur
xev: and to display the information that they contain; it is essentially
xev: a debugging and development tool, and should not be needed in normal
xev: usage.
