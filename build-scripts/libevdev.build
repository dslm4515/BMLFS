# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libevdev: libevdev (wrapper library for evdev devices)
libevdev:
libevdev: libevdev is a wrapper library for evdev devices.  It moves the common
libevdev: tasks when dealing with evdev devices into a library and provides a 
libevdev: library interface to the callers, thus avoiding erroneous ioctls, etc.
