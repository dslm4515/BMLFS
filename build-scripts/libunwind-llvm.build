# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libunwind-llvm: llvm's libunwind
libunwind-llvm:
libunwind-llvm: libunwind is an implementation of the interface defined by the HP 
libunwind-llvm: libunwind project. It was contributed by Apple as a way to enable 
libunwind-llvm: clang++ to port to platforms that do not have a system unwinder. It 
libunwind-llvm: is intended to be a small and fast implementation of the ABI, leaving
libunwind-llvm: off some features of HPâ€™s libunwind that never materialized (e.g. 
libunwind-llvm: remote unwinding)
