# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

ell: ell ( Embedded Linux Library)
ell:
ell: This library provides core, low-level functionality for system 
ell: daemons. It typically has no dependencies other than the Linux 
ell: kernel, C standard library, and libdl (for dynamic linking). While 
ell: ELL is designed to be efficient and compact enough for use on 
ell: embedded Linux platforms, it is not limited to resource-constrained 
ell: systems.
